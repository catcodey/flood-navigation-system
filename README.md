## Flood-Free Routte Identification and Optimization Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning

This is a flood navigation system built using the concept of segmentation on satellite imagery 

###  About
This project was inspired from the Chennai 2015 floods.  
The system integrates the foll 4 concepts water segmentation, elevation-based filtering, road segmentation and shortest path(bfs).  
The goal is to create a map-like visualiation where we identify  as many low lying regions as possible and try to find the shortest path to the nearest elevation points of these regions.  
### Usage
